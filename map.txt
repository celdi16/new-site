yeah i know, this site is super confusing. but im really liking
how it looks at the moment so bare with me, i did descover on
samsung internet it throws a fit, how weird. anyways heres the key:
pink-home (my place to complain about everything)
orange-socials (kinda self explanatory)
red-dev (where i post updates on shards development)
blue-files (where you can view and download files)
green-personal (a trashy biography, i could probably
write much better but ive spent days making this site
and im really tired)
